# Grouper uses Grouper Configuration Overlays (documented on wiki)
# By default the configuration is read from grouper.base.properties
# (which should not be edited), and the grouper.properties overlays
# the base settings.  See the grouper.base.properties for the possible
# settings that can be applied to the grouper.properties
